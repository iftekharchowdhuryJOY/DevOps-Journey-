## Inbound and Outbound Traffic in Networking

1. Inbound Traffic: Data coming into a network from external sources.
2. Outbound Traffic: Data going out from a network to external destination.

## Let's say you have a web server hosting a website.

1. **Inbound Traffic**: When users from the internet visit your website, their requests (HTTP or HTTPS) come into your server. This is considered inbound traffic 
because your server is receiving the request.
2. **Outbound Traffic**: When your web server responds to the user's request by sending back a webpage, the data (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) is sent
out of your server to the user's browser. This is considered outbound traffic.

## Example Scenario
Let's say you have a web server hosting a website.
* Inbound Traffic: When users from the internet visit your website, their requests (HTTP or HTTPS) come into your server. This is considered inbound traffic because your server is receiving the request.

* Outbound Traffic: When your web server responds to the user's request by sending back a webpage, the data (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) is sent out of your server to the user's browser. This is considered outbound traffic.

## Real-Life Example
If you're using AWS EC2 to host a website:
* A user typing your website URL (e.g., www.example.com) results in an inbound request to your EC2 instance.
* Your server sending back the webpage data results in outbound traffic.
