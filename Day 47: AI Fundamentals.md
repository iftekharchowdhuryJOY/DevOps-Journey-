## What is AI?
AI is about creating machines that can learn from data and make decisions. Example: AI in DevOps can predict server failures before they happen.

## What is ML?
ML is a subset of AI where models learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed. Example: A model learns from past CPU usage to predict future workload spikes.

## ML has 3 Main Types:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Supervised Learning (Labeled Data) Example: Spam detection (Emails are labeled as spam or not spam).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Unsupervised Learning (No Labels) Example: Clustering system logs for anomaly detection.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Reinforcement Learning (AI learns by trial and error) Example: AI self-tuning Kubernetes clusters for better performance.

## Lesson 2: Build Linear Regression from Scratch
We'll implement Linear Regression manually so you truly understand how AI models learn.

## üìå What is Linear Regression?
A simple AI model that predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature). The equation is: y = mx + c
where:
y = predicted value
m = slope (weight)
x = input data
c = bias (intercept)

üìå What We Will Do
1Ô∏è‚É£ Load a real dataset (house prices).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Linear Regression using NumPy.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize using Gradient Descent.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Train & visualize predictions.
