## In Terraform, the `provider` keyword is used to specify which cloud service or infrastructure platform you want to manage resources on, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc. A provider is a plugin that Terraform uses to interact with APIs of the chosen platform.

    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-west-2"
    }


This tells Terraform to use the AWS provider and sets the region for resource creation.
