- App: Lint → test → build Docker image → push → deploy

---

## ✅ Month 3: Security-First Infrastructure
**Goal:** Harden cloud infrastructure

### Topics:
- IAM best practices
- Encryption with KMS
- CloudTrail, AWS Config, SCPs

### Project:
🔒 **Secure Cloud Architecture**
- IAM roles, policies
- KMS-enabled S3/RDS
- SCPs + CloudTrail audits

---

## ✅ Month 4: Observability & SRE Basics
**Goal:** Build reliable and observable systems

### Topics:
- CloudWatch metrics/logs/alarms
- Prometheus & Grafana
- X-Ray or OpenTelemetry basics
- SLIs, SLOs, error budgets

### Project:
📈 **Monitoring & Alerting Stack**
- Monitor EC2, RDS, ALB
- Prometheus exporters
- Grafana dashboards

---

## ✅ Month 5: Docker & Kubernetes (EKS)
**Goal:** Deploy and scale apps using EKS

### Topics:
- Docker image creation and hardening
- EKS with Terraform
- Helm basics
- ArgoCD for GitOps

### Project:
🐳 **GitOps App on EKS**
- Dockerize app
- Helm chart + deploy to EKS
- GitOps pipeline with ArgoCD

---

## ✅ Month 6: Cost Optimization + AI Integration
**Goal:** Think like a platform owner

### Topics:
- AWS Budgets, Trusted Advisor
- Spot instances, Savings Plans
- Intro to AI for logs/alerts

### Project:
💰 **Cost-Aware Infra + AI Log Analyzer**
- Add cost dashboards
- Optimize infra
- Use OpenAI API to summarize logs

---

## 🔁 Month 7: Kubernetes Internals Deep Dive
**Goal:** Understand Kubernetes under the hood

### Topics:
- Pod lifecycle, kubelet, scheduler
- Taints/tolerations, affinity
- RBAC, admission controllers

### Project:
🧪 **Build Your Own K8s Cluster (kubeadm)**
- HA setup on VMs
- CNI with Calico or Cilium
- Dashboard to visualize cluster internals

---

## 🔁 Month 8: Platform Engineering & GitOps
**Goal:** Build a reusable developer platform

### Topics:
- ArgoCD/Flux
- Helm vs Kustomize
- Backstage developer portal
- Crossplane for cloud infra as K8s resources

### Project:
🔧 **Internal Dev Platform**
- GitOps app deployment
- Backstage with plugins (ArgoCD, monitoring)
- Crossplane for infra provisioning

---

## 🔁 Month 9: Resilience, Mesh, Multi-Tenancy
**Goal:** Make your cluster production-grade

### Topics:
- Istio/Linkerd for service mesh
- Network policies with Calico
- Kyverno/OPA for multi-tenancy
- Pod disruption budgets, resource quotas

### Project:
🧠 **Enterprise Multi-Tenant K8s Setup**
- Namespaces with isolation and policies
- Secure ingress with Istio + cert-manager
- Mesh features: retries, mTLS, traffic shifting

---

## 🎓 Bonus Activities (Any Time)
