🌩️ What Is Load Testing?

Load testing means simulating real user traffic to your system before real users hit it.

You hit your API, ALB, EC2, ECS, or Lambda with controlled fake traffic:

10 users

100 users

1,000 users

10,000 users

And observe:

latency

error rate

CPU & memory

how your ASG responds

It’s like stress-testing a bridge before letting cars drive over it.

Why Load Testing Matters (The Unfiltered Truth)

Without load testing, you are blind.
You are hoping your system “just works.”

Real world is ruthless — it won’t.

Load testing helps you:

Find scaling bottlenecks

Discover breaking points

Validate ASG behavior

Tune autoscaling policies

Optimize instance types

Detect code inefficiencies

Catch DB saturation

Reveal slow endpoints

Every serious company—from Netflix to Shopify—does this.
Every DevOps engineer who survives production at scale knows this.

🌪️ Types of Load Tests

You’ll mostly use 3:

1️⃣ Load Test

Simulate normal → moderate load.

Goal:
“How does the system behave under expected traffic?”

2️⃣ Stress Test

Push the system beyond expected limits.

Goal:
“Where does it break and how?”

3️⃣ Soak Test (Endurance Test)

Run constant load for hours or days.

Goal:
“Does it leak memory? Slow down? Crash overnight?”

Industry-standard:

⭐ k6 (modern, fast, developer-friendly)

Used for API load tests, CI/CD, high concurrency.

⭐ Locust (Python-based, used for large distributed tests)

Used when testing 50k–500k concurrent users.

⭐ JMeter (legacy but still used in enterprises)

Your first weapon: k6
Because it’s insanely simple and powerful.
