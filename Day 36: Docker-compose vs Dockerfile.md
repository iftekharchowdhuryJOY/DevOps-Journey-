## When You Need Both Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml?
Yes, you need both when:

1. You need to build a custom image (i.e., not using an existing image like nginx or postgres).
2. Your application consists of multiple containers (e.g., a web server + a database).
3. You want easier deployment and container management.

## When You Only Need a Dockerfile
Use only a Dockerfile when:

1. Your project only needs one container.
2. You don't need to manage multiple services (e.g., just running a Node.js app).
3. You plan to build and run the container manually using docker build and docker run.

## When You Only Need docker-compose.yml
Use only docker-compose.yml when:

1. You donâ€™t need a custom-built image and can use official images from Docker Hub.
2. You want to quickly spin up multiple services without a custom Dockerfile.

## Example code 

```
version: "3.8"

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"

  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
```
## ðŸ›  What is docker-compose.yml?
docker-compose.yml is a YAML file used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It orchestrates multiple services like a web application (Flask) and a database (PostgreSQL) together.

* run all services single command: *docker-compose up -d*
  
```
version: "3.8"  # Defines the Compose file format version

services:
  web:
    build: .  # Builds the Flask app from the Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"  # Maps container's port 5000 to host's port 5000
    depends_on:
      - db  # Ensures the database starts before the Flask app
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://myuser:mypassword@db:5432/mydatabase

  db:
    image: postgres:latest  # Uses the official PostgreSQL image
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
      POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  # Persistent storage for DB

volumes:
  postgres_data:  # Defines a named volume for PostgreSQL data
```

1. build: . â†’ This tells Docker Compose to build the Flask app image using the Dockerfile in the current directory (.).
2. ports: â†’ Maps containerâ€™s port 5000 to hostâ€™s port 5000, so you can access Flask via http://localhost:5000.
3. depends_on: â†’ Ensures the database service (db) starts before the Flask app.
4. environment: â†’ Defines environment variables used inside the Flask app. Here, we specify the PostgreSQL connection string.

 ## db: (PostgreSQL Database Service)
 ```
db:
  image: postgres:latest  # Pulls PostgreSQL latest image from Docker Hub
  environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: myuser
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
    POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
  volumes:
    - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

1. image: postgres: latest â†’ Uses the official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub.
2. environment: â†’ Defines credentials for the PostgreSQL database:

* POSTGRES_USER â†’ Sets the username.
* POSTGRES_PASSWORD â†’ Sets the password.
* POSTGRES_DB â†’ Creates a new database.
3. volumes: â†’ Maps persistent storage for the database. This ensures data is not lost when the container restarts.

## all docker-compose commands
1. docker-compose up -d
2. docker ps
3. docker-compose logs web
4. docker-compose logs db
5. docker-compose down

## ðŸš€ Difference Between Image and Container

Docker image: A read-only blueprint that contains everything needed to run an application (code, dependencies, environment).
Docker container: A running instance of a Docker image. It is created from an image and runs in an isolated environment.

## Real-World Analogy
* Docker Image â†’ Like a recipe for making a cake.
* Docker Container â†’ Like the actual baked cake made from the recipe.

## ðŸ›  Does Docker Compose Create a Container?
Yes, Docker Compose creates containers when you run: docker-compose up -d
* The command builds the image.
* Then creates and runs containers for each service defined in docker-compose.yml

## ðŸ“Œ Which Commands Create an Image?
If you are building an image manually from Dockerfile:
docker build -t my-image . 
1. docker build - creates a docker image.
2. -t my-image: -t means tags. tags the image with the name my-image.
3. dot means use the current directory as build context.

If you have a docker-compose.yml file, you can build images using: docker-compose build

## ðŸ“Œ Which Command Creates a Container?
1. Using docker run (Manually Running a Container): docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name my-container my-image
```
* docker run â†’ Creates and starts a container from an image.
* -d â†’ Runs it in detached mode (background).
* -p 5000:5000 â†’ Maps container port 5000 to host port 5000.
* --name my-container â†’ Assigns a name to the container.
* my-image â†’ The image to use.

```
check running container: docker ps
check images: docker images
stop the container: docker stop container-name
remove the container: docker rm container-name

##  Using docker-compose up (Creates and Runs Containers)
1. docker-compose up -d
2. docker ps
3. docker-compose down

```
Build Images Only: 	docker-compose build
Build Images & Run Containers: 	docker-compose up -d
Rebuild Images & Restart Containers:	docker-compose up --build -d
List Running Containers: 	docker ps
List Built Images:	docker images
Stop & Remove Containers:	docker-compose down

```
## Why Don't We Define the Database (db) in the Dockerfile?
we don't define PostgreSQL (db) inside the Dockerfile is because Dockerfile is meant to build a single application 
image, while the database is a separate service that should run independently.

## Avoid Making the Flask Image Heavy
If we install PostgreSQL inside the Flask container, it would make the image unnecessarily large.
This also makes the container difficult to manage, as both Flask and PostgreSQL would be running inside the same container.

The main reason why not add DB in Dockerfile?
1. app and db should run separately.
2. Installing PostgreSQL in Flaskâ€™s image makes it too large.
3. Allows easy scaling and independent updates.
4. PostgreSQL already has an optimized official Docker image.

**The best practice is to define PostgreSQL as a separate service in docker-compose.yml, not inside the Dockerfile.**
