Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) has baseline performance rules based on object access patterns and request rates.
1. Baseline Throughput per Prefix
* 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE requests per second per prefix
* 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix
âœ… No need to pre-partition your bucket like old days!

ðŸ§© What is a Prefix?
A prefix is the part of the object key before the first /.
Example:

Bucket: my-app-bucket
Object Key: logs/2025/05/01/logfile1.txt
Prefix: logs/2025/05/01/
This means S3 performance scales per prefix, not just the entire bucket.

## Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration
S3 Transfer Acceleration uses Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s edge locations to speed up file uploads and downloads to your S3 bucket from long-distance locations
âš¡ How It Works (Real Life Style)
Letâ€™s say youâ€™re in Bangladesh and your S3 bucket is in US East (N. Virginia).

âœ… Normal Upload:
Your file travels all the way to the US, which takes time.

âœ… With Transfer Acceleration:
You upload to the nearest AWS edge location, e.g., in Mumbai or Singapore. From there, Amazonâ€™s internal fast AWS network moves the file to the US.

ðŸ“¦ Result: Much faster uploads and downloads over long distances!
ðŸ§ª How to Enable It?
Go to your S3 bucket.

Go to Properties.

Scroll to Transfer Acceleration.

Click Edit â†’ Enable.

Use the accelerated endpoint:
