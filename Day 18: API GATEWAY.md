## What is API Gateway?
1. create, deploy & manage APIs at scale.
2. entry point for applications to communicate with backend services such as AWS Lambda, EC2, DynamoDB, or on-premise servers.

# Key Features of API Gateway:
✅ Manages API Requests – Routes, processes, and manages API calls
✅ Authentication & Authorization – Works with Cognito, IAM, Lambda Authorizers
✅ Traffic Control – Supports rate limiting and throttling to control API traffic
✅ Logging & Monitoring – Integrated with CloudWatch for request tracking
✅ Caching – Reduces backend load with response caching
✅ Security – Supports TLS encryption, WAF integration, and access control policies

## How API Gateway Works
1. Client makes a request → A mobile app, website, or system calls the API
2. API Gateway receives the request → It acts as a proxy
3. Request processing → API Gateway:
    * Validates authentication (via Cognito, IAM, or Lambda Authorizers)
    * Applies throttling and rate limits
    * Transforms or maps request data if needed
4. API Gateway routes the request → Sends it to Lambda, EC2, DynamoDB, or another service
5. Backend processes the request → Returns the response
6. API Gateway returns the response → The client receives the data

## Cost of API Gateway
API Gateway charges are based on:

1. API Requests – $3.50 per million requests (for REST API)
2. Data Transfer – Standard AWS data transfer rates apply
3. Caching (Optional) – Additional cost for API Gateway caching

## 📌 Example Cost for 10M Requests Per Month (REST API):

* 10M requests x $3.50 per million = $35/month
* If using HTTP API (cheaper alternative), cost would be ~$10/month

If you're building a web app with many APIs, you need API Gateway to manage, secure, and expose those APIs. Here’s why:




3️⃣ Example: API Gateway in a Web App
Imagine you're building a SaaS web app with these APIs:

User Authentication API (Cognito) → /login, /signup
Product API (DynamoDB) → /products, /product/{id}
Order API (Lambda) → /order/{id}, /checkout
Payments API (Stripe) → /payment/process
Instead of exposing each API separately, you use AWS API Gateway:

1️⃣ Frontend Calls API Gateway → https://api.yourapp.com/orders/1234
2️⃣ API Gateway Handles Security → Checks user authentication (Cognito)
3️⃣ API Gateway Routes Request → Sends request to the correct service (Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.)
4️⃣ Backend Processes Request → Returns response
5️⃣ API Gateway Sends Response → Securely sends data to the frontend

This hides backend services from direct exposure, protects sensitive data, and ensures smooth API performance.


4️⃣ Final Answer: Do You Need API Gateway?
✅ If your web app has multiple APIs → Yes, use API Gateway
✅ If your APIs are public-facing → Yes, use API Gateway for security
✅ If your backend is on AWS (Lambda, EC2, DynamoDB, RDS, etc.) → Yes, API Gateway helps manage and expose these APIs securely

🚀 Bottom Line: Always use API Gateway before exposing APIs—it secures, manages, and optimizes your backend services!
