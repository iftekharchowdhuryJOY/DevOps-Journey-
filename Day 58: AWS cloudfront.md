AWS CloudFront is a fully managed CDN (Content Delivery Network) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It helps deliver content (such as websites, videos, APIs, etc.) faster by caching it at edge locations worldwide.
# What is a content delivery network (CDN)
# Which Companies Use AWS CloudFront?
Many large enterprises, startups, and media companies rely on CloudFront for fast, secure, and scalable content delivery. Some well-known users include:

- Netflix (for video streaming)
- Twitch (live video delivery)
- Airbnb (static assets & dynamic content)
- Slack (app updates & file sharing)
- Zoom (software downloads)
- Reddit (web acceleration & caching)
- Disney+ (video streaming & security)
- Spotify (music & app content delivery)

# When Should You Use CloudFront?
✅ You have global users and want low latency.
✅ You need DDoS protection & security (AWS WAF + Shield).
✅ You host static files (JS, CSS, images) or stream videos.
✅ You want to offload traffic from your origin server (S3, EC2, etc.).

# Real-World Example: How Netflix Uses CloudFront
Problem: Netflix needs to deliver high-quality video to millions of users with minimal buffering.
# Solution:
- Uses CloudFront + AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic efficiently.
- Caches popular videos at edge locations for faster playback.
- Uses Lambda@Edge to personalize content (e.g., A/B testing thumbnails).
- Result: Smooth streaming experience even during peak hours.
# What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?
A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a globally distributed network of servers that cache and deliver web content (like images, videos, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) from locations closest to the user.
Instead of serving all requests from a single origin server, a CDN stores copies of your content in multiple edge locations (data centers worldwide) to reduce latency and improve speed.
Why Do You Need CloudFront (CDN) Even If Your Website is Already Accessible Globally?
Even if your website is hosted on a server that’s accessible worldwide, without a CDN, all users connect directly to your origin server, leading to several problems:

1. High Latency (Slower Load Times)
- Without CDN: A user in Japan accessing a server in the US will experience delays due to long-distance data travel.
- With CloudFront: The content is cached in an edge location in Tokyo, so the user gets it faster.
**Example: A blog with images loads in 2 seconds instead of 5 seconds.**

2. Increased Server Load (Higher Costs & Downtime Risk)
- Without CDN: Every user request hits your origin server (e.g., EC2, S3, or your web host), increasing bandwidth costs and server load.
- With CloudFront: 90% of requests are served from edge caches, reducing origin server traffic.
**Example: If 10,000 users visit your site, only 1,000 requests reach your server (rest are cached).**

3. Poor Performance During Traffic Spikes
- Without CDN: A sudden surge in visitors (e.g., a viral post) can crash your server.
- With CloudFront: Traffic is distributed across edge locations, preventing overload.
**Example: A product launch gets 100K visits—CloudFront handles the load smoothly.**

4. Higher Bandwidth Costs
- Without CDN: You pay for all outbound data transfer from your origin (e.g., S3 or EC2).
- With CloudFront: AWS’s CDN pricing is often cheaper than direct server bandwidth.
**Example: Serving 1TB of videos monthly might cost $85 via S3 vs. $50 via CloudFront.**

5. Security Risks (DDoS Attacks, Hotlinking)
- Without CDN: Your origin server’s IP is exposed, making it vulnerable to attacks.

# With CloudFront:
- DDoS Protection (AWS Shield Standard included).
- AWS WAF blocks malicious traffic.
- Hotlink Prevention (stops other sites from stealing your images/videos).
**Example: A competitor can’t embed your images on their site without permission.**

6. No Advanced Optimization
- Without CDN: No automatic image compression, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 (QUIC), or Brotli/Gzip compression.
- With CloudFront: Faster delivery with modern protocols and optimizations.

**Example: A 2MB image gets compressed to 1.4MB, saving bandwidth.**

# Real-World Example: WordPress Site with CloudFront
Problem: A WordPress site hosted in the US loads slowly in India (~4s).
## Solution:

- CloudFront caches static files (CSS, JS, images) in Mumbai edge location.
- Users in India now get content locally (~0.8s load time).
- Server load drops by 70%, reducing hosting costs.
Result: Happier users, better SEO (Google ranks faster sites higher), and lower bills.

# Cloudfront Geo-restrictions
Geo-Restrictions allow you to block or allow users from specific countries from accessing your content via CloudFront.

# CloudFront Pricing Overview
## What You Pay For:
- Data Transfer Out (per GB, varies by region)
Example: Delivering 1TB/month in North America ≈ $85

- HTTP/HTTPS Requests (per 10,000 requests): Example: 1M requests ≈ $0.75
- Invalidations (First 1,000 paths free/month, then $0.005/invalidation)
- DDoS Protection (AWS Shield Standard: Free, Advanced: $3,000+/month)

# What is Multiple Origins?
Route different requests to different backend servers (e.g., APIs to EC2, static files to S3).

## Example Setup:

1. /api/* → ALB (EC2 backend)
2. /images/* → S3 bucket
3. Default (/*) → Another S3 bucket
## Use Case:
A Next.js app with:

- Static pages (S3)
- API routes (Lambda)
- Uploads (Separate S3 bucket)

# What is Origin Groups (Failover)
Automatically switch to a backup origin if the primary fails (like a standby server).
## How It Works:
1. Primary Origin: primary-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
2. Secondary Origin: backup-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
3. CloudFront checks primary’s health; if it returns 5xx errors, traffic shifts to secondary.

## Use Case:
- High-availability news site where downtime is unacceptable.

## Field-level Encryption
Encrypt specific form fields (e.g., credit card numbers) before they reach your server.
## Example Flow:
1. User submits a payment form (card_number=1234-5678-9012-3456).
2. CloudFront encrypts only the card_number field using a public key.
3. Your backend decrypts it with the private key.

### Use Case:
PCI-compliant e-commerce checkout (extra security for sensitive data).

## Cache Invalidation
What? Force CloudFront to fetch fresh content before the TTL expires.

## Cost:
- First 1,000 paths/month → Free
- Additional → $0.005 per path

**Pro Tip:**
- Use versioned filenames (e.g., styles-v2.css) to avoid invalidations.
