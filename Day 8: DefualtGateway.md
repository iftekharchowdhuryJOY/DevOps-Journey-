# Default Gateway
Main door of the building. Exit point.
From my laptop i am sending a text to my GF, then data will first go to default gateway then it will send it to the destiantion. 

## What Is It?
The default gateway is the device (usually a router) that connects your local network to other networks, such as the internet. It's the "exit point" for data leaving your network.
- How Does It Work? When a device wants to send data to another device outside its network: The data is sent to the default gateway. The gateway forwards the data to its destination.
Example
If your network uses the range 192.168.1.0/24 (subnet mask 255.255.255.0), the default gateway might be 192.168.1.1. Devices like phones, laptops, and printers send traffic to 192.168.1.1 to access the internet.
