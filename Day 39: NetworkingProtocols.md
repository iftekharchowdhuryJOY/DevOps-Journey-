1. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
What it is:
TCP: Ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data.
IP: Handles addressing and routing to ensure data packets reach the correct destination.
How it works:
TCP:
Establishes a connection (3-way handshake).
Breaks data into packets and ensures they are delivered in the correct order.
Retransmits lost packets.
IP:
Adds source and destination IP addresses to each packet.
Routes packets through the network.
Real-life Example:
Video Call (e.g., Zoom):
TCP ensures the connection remains stable, retransmitting lost packets if needed for a clear video stream.

2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
What it is:
Connectionless protocol with faster transmission but no guarantee of delivery or order.
How it works:
Sends data as independent packets without waiting for acknowledgment.
Real-life Example:
Video Streaming (e.g., Netflix):
UDP transmits video frames quickly. If a frame is lost, it doesn’t retransmit because it would slow down the stream.

3. HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure)
What it is:
HTTP: Protocol for transferring web pages and data between browsers and servers.
HTTPS: Secure version of HTTP using encryption (SSL/TLS).
How it works:
Client (your browser) sends an HTTP request to a server.
Server responds with the requested data (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
In HTTPS, encryption ensures data is secure from eavesdropping.
Real-life Example:
Loading a Webpage (e.g., shopping on Amazon):
Your browser uses HTTPS to securely fetch the webpage content.

4. DNS (Domain Name System)
What it is:
Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 8.8.8.8).
How it works:
Your device sends a query to the DNS server.
The DNS server returns the corresponding IP address for the domain.
Real-life Example:
Typing a URL:
When you type google.com, DNS resolves it to 142.250.64.78.

5. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
What it is:
Used for transferring files between a client and server.
How it works:
Client connects to the FTP server.
Files are uploaded or downloaded.
Real-life Example:
Uploading a Website:
Developers use FTP to upload website files to the hosting server.

6. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
What it is:
Protocol for sending emails.
How it works:
Your email client sends the message to an SMTP server.
The SMTP server forwards the email to the recipient's mail server.
Real-life Example:
Sending an Email (e.g., Gmail):
SMTP sends your message to the recipient’s email server.
7. IMAP/POP3 (Email Retrieval Protocols)
What they are:
IMAP: Keeps emails on the server, allowing access from multiple devices.
POP3: Downloads emails to your device and deletes them from the server.
Real-life Example:
Checking Emails on Your Phone:
IMAP allows you to access your inbox from multiple devices.
8. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
What it is:
Assigns IP addresses dynamically to devices on a network.
How it works:
A device sends a DHCP request when joining a network.
The DHCP server assigns an available IP address.
Real-life Example:
Connecting to Wi-Fi:
Your router assigns your phone an IP address via DHCP.
9. SSH (Secure Shell Protocol)
What it is:
Provides secure remote access to devices over a network.
How it works:
Encrypts all data exchanged between the client and server.
Real-life Example:
Managing a Server:
Admins use SSH to log into servers remotely for maintenance.

10. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
What it is:
Used for error reporting and diagnostics.
How it works:
Devices use ICMP to send status messages (e.g., unreachable network, ping responses).
Real-life Example:
Ping Command:
ICMP checks if a device (e.g., google.com) is reachable.

11. TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer)
What it is:
Protocols for encrypting data in transit.
How it works:
Client and server perform a handshake to exchange encryption keys.
Data is encrypted before transmission.
Real-life Example:
Online Banking:
TLS secures sensitive information like passwords and transactions.
