# What’s Inside a Router?
A router has the following key components:

1. Processor (CPU): Handles routing decisions, like managing traffic and translating IP addresses.
2. Memory:
- RAM: Stores temporary data like the routing table (current device connections).
- Flash Memory: Stores the firmware (router’s operating system).
3. Network Ports:
- WAN Port: Connects to the modem for internet access.
- LAN Ports: Connects to your local network (wired) devices.
4. Wireless Module (for Wi-Fi routers): Enables communication with wireless devices using standards like Wi-Fi 5 or Wi-Fi 6.
5. Firmware: The router's software, controls how it operates and manages traffic.
6. Power Supply: Powers the router and its internal components.
