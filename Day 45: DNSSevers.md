# DNS Servers
## What Is It?
A DNS server (Domain Name System server) translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.64.78), which computers use to locate resources on a network.
## How Does It Work?
When you type a website (e.g., www.google.com) into your browser: Your computer sends a query to the DNS server. The DNS server responds with the corresponding IP address. Your computer uses this IP address to connect to the website.
## How These Work Together
When your computer sends a request to access a website:
1. The subnet mask determines whether the destination is within the same network or another network.
2. If it's outside your network, the request is sent to the default gateway.
3. The default gateway forwards the request, and the DNS server resolves the domain name to an IP address.
4. The data reaches its destination
