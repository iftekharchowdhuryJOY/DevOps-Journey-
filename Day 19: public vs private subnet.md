> The DevOps team at an IT company is provisioning a two-tier application in a VPC with a public subnet and a private subnet. The team wants to use either a Network Address Translation (NAT) instance or a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway in the public subnet to enable instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the internet but needs some technical assistance in terms of the configuration options available for the Network Address Translation (NAT) instance and the Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.
As a solutions architect, which of the following options would you identify as CORRECT? (Select three)

answer:
* Security Groups can be associated with a NAT instance
* NAT instance can be used as a bastion server
* NAT instance supports port forwarding

## What is two-tier Application? 
A two-tier application is a client-server architecture that consists of two layers:

1. Tier 1 (Client Layer): The front-end, where users interact with the application (e.g., web browser, mobile app).
2. Tier 2 (Server Layer): The back-end, which processes requests, manages business logic, and interacts with a database.

## Example of a Two-Tier Application
Imagine an E-commerce Website:

* Client Tier (Tier 1): A user visits the website using a browser (React.js frontend).
* Server Tier (Tier 2): A backend (Node.js, Python, or Java) receives user requests, processes data, and retrieves product details from a database (e.g., MySQL).

In AWS, a two-tier setup could be:
1. Frontend in the Public Subnet (e.g., hosted on EC2 or an S3 Static Website).
2. Backend in the Private Subnet (e.g., an EC2 instance running a backend API and database, accessible only from the frontend).

## What is a Public and Private Subnet?
A subnet is a logical division of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that helps organize and control network access.

## Public Subnet
* Has direct internet access via an Internet Gateway (IGW).
* Used for hosting publicly accessible resources like web servers, bastion hosts, and NAT instances.
* Example: A web server running on EC2 that users can access via a domain.
## Private Subnet
* Does NOT have direct internet access.
* Used for hosting resources that should remain secure, like databases and internal applications.
* Can access the internet via a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance for updates.
* Example: A backend API server that should only be accessible from a web application.

To allow instances in the private subnet to reach the internet, Network Address Translation (NAT) is needed. The team can choose between:

1. NAT Instance – A manually configured EC2 instance that performs NAT.
2. NAT Gateway – A fully managed AWS service that performs NAT.

## Security Groups can be associated with a NAT instance

✅ Correct: NAT instances are EC2 instances, and security groups can be attached to them.
Why? Since a NAT instance is just an EC2 instance running NAT software, you can attach security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
NAT instance can be used as a bastion server

✅ Correct: A NAT instance can also function as a bastion host.
Why? A bastion server (or jump box) is an instance that allows secure SSH access to instances in the private subnet. If configured correctly, the NAT instance can serve this dual purpose by allowing SSH connections to private instances while also enabling outbound internet access.
NAT instance supports port forwarding

✅ Correct: NAT instances can be manually configured to support port forwarding.
Why? Since NAT instances are EC2 instances, you can configure iptables or other networking tools to forward specific ports.

## Difference Between NAT Instance and NAT Gateway
When setting up private subnets in AWS, instances in the private subnet cannot access the internet directly. To enable outbound internet access while keeping them secure from direct inbound traffic, AWS offers two solutions:

NAT Instance – A manually configured EC2 instance that performs Network Address Translation (NAT).
NAT Gateway – A fully managed AWS service that performs NAT automatically.

✅ Using a NAT Gateway (Recommended for Production)

* Public Subnet: NAT Gateway + Web Server.
* Private Subnet: Backend and database instances.
* Routing: Private instances route outbound traffic through the NAT Gateway.

✅ Using a NAT Instance (For Cost-Saving)

Public Subnet: NAT Instance (EC2) + Web Server.
Private Subnet: Backend instances.
Routing: Private instances use NAT Instance’s Elastic IP for outbound traffic.
