## IAM Policies 
Policy- JSON documents that define permissions 
Attached to: Users, groups, or roles
Types:
- AWS managed policies
- Customer managed policies
- Inline policies

## AWS evaluates permissions by combining all policies:

1. Default = Deny (if no policy â†’ no access).

2. Explicit Deny > Allow (deny always wins).

3. Explicit Allow â†’ access is granted unless denied elsewhere.

4. Permissions are cumulative (group + user + role).


# IAM Policy Structure

```code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
* Version â†’ always "2012-10-17".
* Statement â†’ list of rules.
* Effect â†’ Allow or Deny.
* Action â†’ API calls (e.g., ec2:StartInstances).
* Resource â†’ ARN of resource (e.g., arn:aws:s3:::bucket/*).
* Condition â†’ optional constraints (IP, MFA, time, tags).

## IAM Password Policy
You can enforce rules for IAM user passwords.

Examples:

Minimum length

Require numbers, uppercase, lowercase, special chars

Password expiration

Prevent password reuse

ðŸ‘‰ Managed at the account level (not per user).


## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Adds a second layer of security. Even if password/keys are stolen â†’ canâ€™t login.

Options:

Virtual MFA App (Google Authenticator, Authy, AWS MFA app).

U2F Security Key (YubiKey, FIDO2 keys).

Hardware MFA Device (Gemalto tokens).

SMS MFA (for AWS GovCloud only, mostly deprecated).

ðŸ‘‰ Exam tip: Virtual MFA is the most common.

## IAM Roles for AWS Services

Roles are used when AWS services need permissions:

* EC2 Role â†’ instance profile, lets EC2 access S3/DynamoDB.

* Lambda Execution Role â†’ allows Lambda to access DynamoDB/SQS.

* ECS Task Role â†’ gives container-specific permissions.

* CloudFormation Service Role â†’ allows CFN to create/manage resources.

ðŸ‘‰ No long-term credentials, only temporary STS tokens delivered by AWS.


## IAM Security Tools

AWS provides built-in tools:

- IAM Credentials Report â†’ lists all users, keys, MFA, last usage.

- IAM Access Advisor â†’ shows last-used services for a user/role.

- Access Analyzer â†’ detects resources (S3, KMS, IAM) shared with external accounts.

- Policy Simulator â†’ test what a policy actually allows/denies.

# IAM Best Practices

 - Donâ€™t use root account (enable MFA, lock it away).
 - Use IAM roles instead of embedding keys in apps.   
 - Grant least privilege (start restrictive â†’ open up if needed).   
 - Rotate credentials regularly.   
 - Enable MFA for all IAM users.   
 - Use groups for permissions, not direct user policies.   
 - Audit IAM using Credentials Report & CloudTrail.   
 - Use IAM Access Analyzer to spot overly permissive access.

# IAM Integration Scenarios

 ## IAM + S3 (Accessing Buckets)

### Real-life example

-   You have an **EC2 app** that needs to **read/write S3 objects**.
    
-   Instead of embedding keys â†’ use an **IAM Role** attached to the EC2 instance.

Policy Example

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"
      }]
    }

 Attach this to the **EC2 Role**.  
Now EC2 can fetch S3 creds from **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)** automatically.

**Exam Tip:** If app canâ€™t access S3 â†’ check:

-   Role attached?
    
-   Policy correct resource ARN (bucket vs bucket/*)?

# IAM + CloudWatch (Logs/Monitoring)
### Real-life example

-   Lambda â†’ needs permission to write logs to CloudWatch.
    
Policy:

    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }



## Whatâ€™s usually _extra_ on the exam (donâ€™t skip):

-   **Temporary credentials (STS)** â†’ `AssumeRole`, session duration, intersection of session policy & role policy.
    
-   **Cross-account roles** â†’ trust policy + permission policy needed (they love this scenario).
    
-   **SigV4 signing** â†’ for API Gateway & S3 presigned URLs (highly testable).
    
-   **Resource vs identity policies** â†’ e.g., S3 bucket policy vs IAM user policy.
    
-   **Condition keys** â†’ especially MFA (`aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent`), source IP (`aws:SourceIp`), request tags.
    
-   **Permissions boundaries vs SCPs** (know the difference conceptually).
