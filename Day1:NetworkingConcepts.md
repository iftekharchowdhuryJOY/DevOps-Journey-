# What is networking?
Me and my friend talking about last night Football match. Sharing memes in our phone, create groups, invite other friends, print a photo of messi. This is called Networking. 
Now in computer science, just think about you and your friend have a computer or phone. You both have a internet connection, your phone, laptops or PCs connected with internet where you guys share resources like images, memes, creating groups etc
Your printer is connected with your computer, this is what called Networking in Computer science term. 
Simply where multiple devices connected with internet and sharing various resources. That's it.

Now, suppose i don't have internet connection, can i be a part of network? Yes, But it's called Local network. However, remember that your computer is not a part of network that extend beyond itself. What do you mean by that? Simply you can't share resources with your friends.
Download the files from websites.

If your computer is not connected to any other device (no LAN, Wi-Fi, or internet connection), it is isolated. It is not part of any network. it is called a standalone device.
Networks don’t require the internet to exist. A private network can function independently for file sharing, printing, or gaming.
if your computer isn’t connected to any other devices, it is not part of a network. If it is connected to a local network, it remains part of that network, regardless of internet connectivity. That's it :)
